> Spoiler alert those information are based on my experience. 
> Generally, there is a tax for any product in Portugal, which was about 23% for electronic equipments. 
> I bought some equipments there such as an external HD, a new laptop and so on last year. I did not pay that tax due to 
> my type of VISA(not a tourist VISA). I mean I was buying as my work tools. The whole process is pretty much straightforward. 
> For instance the product tax(IVA) has to be paid at the moment of purchasing and it can be got back at the moment of IVA declaration, 
> which has to be done quarterly in my case because I was working as a freelance.
